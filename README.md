# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

By modifying starter code, I have created a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

I used the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.

## Installation

When the scheduler is opened, the current date and time is displayed at the top. The timer updates by the second in real time. Scroll down to view the work day from 9AM to 6PM. Timeblocks are color-coded:

  * Gray indicates the past
  * Red indicates the current hour
  * Green indicates the future

Click inside a timeblock to enter events and appointment information and click the save button to save your input in local storage. The saved inputs persist when the page is refreshed.
